# Object Oriented Programming: A Multi-Language Examination

`Online Format`

Lectures are 30 minutes. Labs are 90 minutes. Quizzes are 15 minutes.

Each lab comes with a 5 minute instruction video and a 25 minute solution video. Thus labs are 90 minutes (student time) + 30 minutes video = 2 hours.

Modules are 6 lectures, 1 lab, 1 quiz = 315 minutes. 315 * 4 = 21 hours.
