# Encapsulation
  - OO vs Functional
  - Evolution of OO:
    - Encapsulation: functions taking "this" 
    - Polymorphism: pointers-to-functions ... behaviors
  - Time keeper example
  - Objects vs Classes
  - Statics vs Members
  - Software Reuse

# Inheritance
  - Interface vs Implementation
  - Program to the interface, not the implementation
  - Diamond of death
  - Animal talking (robot, cat, dog, wolf, werwolf)
  - Composition
  - IOC (DI)

# Design Patterns
  - super, base, derived, sub-class, is-a, has-a
  - decorator
  - prototype languages (JS)
  
# Guidelines and UML
  - SOLID and GRASP guidelines
  - UML modeling
  - Prototype languages (JS)

Terry asked for a commercial:

> Would you have time in the next few weeks to do a little "commercial" talking about OOP, what it is, content, why they should take it, and a bit about yourself.
> 
> Doesn't have to be more than 1-2 minutes. 
> 
> I'd like to put something out there for marketing purposes. 
> 
> They'll begin marketing fall courses in the April/May timeframe. 
> 
> Thoughts?

The commercial could go like this (random thoughts, not a script):

OO concepts are applicable to many programming languages. In this course I'll introduce the basic concepts of OO: Ecapsulation and Inheritance. I'll show where they come from and why we need them. I'll compare/contrast the features and syntax in popular languages like Python, Java, and C++. I'll talk about OO design patterns, community accepted guidelines for OO structures. I'll look at OO thought process -- modeling and UML diagrams. You don't need to be an expert in any language, but you'll get a taste of OO in multiple languages with simple in-class lab exercises that demonstrate OO concepts.
