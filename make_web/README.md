# Modules

The `Modules` page is the course outline. There is an "Introductions" section with notes from PCS.

The remaining sections are course sections.

# Files

The Files section includes course materials and the art used to make the lectures.

The `media` folder off of the course root contains the materials used to make the lectures. These are
usually embedded images in the lecture page.
