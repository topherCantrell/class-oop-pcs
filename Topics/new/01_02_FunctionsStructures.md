Subroutines. The stack. JSR. Push. Pop.

reusable subroutines. breaking up long programs into manageable functions
that can be tested separately and tied together and reused.

Example of the assembly

Structures ... defining data primitives. Building them up.

The dance. Now we have functions that work on structures. All grouped together.
Show getters and setters. Why not just dip into the structure directly?

Next ... what time is it?
