Encapsulation. Hiding behind code.

On the one hand, the dipping is very fast. But on the other, you can do range
checking and such with code. Which is better? The speed or the flexibility?
The answer is it depends!

Should you design for flexibility and then optimize the critical pieces? Should
you optimize for speed and only make the high level parts flexible? You need
a crystal ball to find out how your code is going to be used in the future.
