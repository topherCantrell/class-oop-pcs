Maybe Student Record: list of 10 grades, char array for name, int for age

Now the set_grade makes more sense. We don't have to worry about the layout of the data structure.

set_grade(bobby,7

Kind of like the passive voice. The car was driven by Paul. The burger was eaten by Pat. The focus is on the verb.

Switch around to say Paul drove the car. Pat ate the burger. The focus is on the noun.

TODO add other functions. Code increases.

TODO now make a datastructure -- name + grades. Structures increases.


z  - next add functions (routines)  and data (structures)
z  - OO is about organizing these routines -- and keeping them together with their data
  
OO is about organizing a large number of functions and structures.
small programs -- tools -- don't require a great deal of overall structure. 
OO makes more sense -- easier to understand -- with large systems. Which can be challenging in a classroom.

Program to get the average/lowest/highest for a list of grades: easy. Requires loops and algorithms and if
statements -- standard entry-level CS stuff.

Show array of floats. Get average, Get lowest/highest. Main function. How to enhance for multiple tests. What
if tests are more than a list of grades? (date topic). Add self parameter.
