Terry asked for a commercial:

The commercial could go like this (random thoughts, not a script):

OO concepts are applicable to many programming languages. In this course I'll introduce the basic concepts of OO: Ecapsulation and Inheritance. I'll show where they come from and why we need them. I'll compare/contrast the features and syntax in popular languages like Python, Java, and C++. I'll talk about OO design patterns, community accepted guidelines for OO structures. I'll look at OO thought process -- modeling and UML diagrams. You don't need to be an expert in any language, but you'll get a taste of OO in multiple languages with simple in-class lab exercises that demonstrate OO concepts.
